I recently installed railwaycat's Emacs for Mac.

Here is the repo

[https://github.com/railwaycat/homebrew-emacsmacport](https://github.com/railwaycat/homebrew-emacsmacport)


### To install it with homebrew run following commands

{% highlight bash %}
brew tap railwaycat/emacsmacport
{% endhighlight %}

then
{% highlight bash %}
brew install emacs-mac
{% endhighlight %}

If you are using cask

{% highlight bash %}
brew cask install emacs-mac
{% endhighlight %}



### What did I like from railwaycat's Emacs fork

1. You get to use tabs with Emacs.
  To enable, go to Options -> Show/Hide -> Check Tab Bar

2. Dictionary lookup support
  If you press Ctrl+Cmd+D, you can lookup currently selected word

3. Emoji support
  If you press Ctrl+Cmd+Space, you can type Emoji charaters into a Emacs buffer

4. Fullscreen
  If you can press <f11> which maps to `toggle-frame-fullscreen`, you can make frame go fullscreen.

5. I will be adding more features specific to macOS from railsway Emacs fork here. Watch this space.
