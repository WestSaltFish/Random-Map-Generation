Here is how I search on Twitter


1. Searching term in tweets of people I follow

    ```
    aeropress filter:follows
    ```

2. Searching a term in the tweets of people from a particular list

    ```
    aeropress list:anildigital/classy
    ```

3. Searching term in the tweets of specific person

    ```
    aeropress from:mehulved
    ```

These are some pretty regular ways I search on Twitter. But for more specific searches, you can read more here
