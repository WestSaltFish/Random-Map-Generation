Bash provides many hot keys to ease use. Like<br /><br /><br />ctrl-l -- clear screen<br />ctrl-r -- does a search in the previously given commands so that you don't have to repeat long command.<br />ctrl-u -- clears the typing before the hotkey.<br />ctrl-a -- takes you to the beginning of the command you are currently typing.<br />ctrl-e -- takes you to the end of the command you are currently typing in.<br />esc-b -- takes you back by one word while typing a command.<br />ctrl-c -- kills the current command or process.<br />ctrl-d -- kills the shell.<br />ctrl-h -- deletes one letter at a time from the command you are typing in.<br />ctrl-z -- puts the currently running process in background, the process can be brought back to run state by using fg command.<br />esc-p -- like ctrl-r lets you search through the previously given commands.<br />esc-. -- gives the last command you typed.<br /><br /><br />These proved extremely useful for me.
