<p align="justify">I am creating a Social Bookmarks Manager as my BE project! I have created some part of it! While explaining the concept of Social Bookmarks Manager to my friends and teachers, I always show <a href="http://del.icio.us/">del.icio.us</a>! I help them to create their account on del.icio.us. They post some links. They understand tags concept! Some of them like the site. But the common problem for all is that they forget del.icio.us’s link! The Rashmi Sinha <a href="http://www.rashmisinha.com/archives/06_03/delicious-tax.html">experienced the same</a>! She wrote “<em>What delicious irony in that the url we use to remember our other urls is so hard to remember. Its almost as if some of the mental energy freed up by offloading all other urls is taken up by remembering how to spell del.icio.us. Its the del.icio.us tax! I for one am glad to pay it.</em>”</p>
