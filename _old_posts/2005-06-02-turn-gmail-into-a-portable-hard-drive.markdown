Today while doing my daily routine of surfing for new interesting things, I stumbled upon this new very interesting service <a href="http://www.gmailharddrive.com/beta/">Gmail Hard Drive</a>, this site enables you to use your Gmail account as a 2GB Online Storage that you can access from everywhere, I donâ€™t know about you but I really needed a service like this, only if I could upload at a higher speed. <p></p><span class="technoratitag">Technorati Tags: <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tags/Gmail" rel="tag">Gmail</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tags/Storage" rel="tag">Storage</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tags/HardDisk" rel="tag">HardDisk</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tags/Online" rel="tag">Online</a></span>
