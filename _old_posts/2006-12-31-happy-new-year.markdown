<p>The year 2006 was very different for me.&nbsp;It's one of the ultimate years in my life.&nbsp;2006&nbsp;was a turning point year&nbsp;of my life too. Lots of things happened. It's difficult to write about all the nice things. <br />Mainly <br />I graduated to become a Bachelor of Computer Engineering from Pune University. <br />I did my final year BE project sponsored by Patni Computers, Pune.&nbsp;<br />I will never forget Satish&nbsp;Sir for his invaluable help and guidance. <br />I found Ruby and Ruby on Rails.<br />I got my first job.<br />I worked on first live project.&nbsp;<br />I got chance to work with great people, specially Shashank Sir. <br />We bought a&nbsp;house in Pune(previously we were living in Govt quarters).&nbsp;<br />My final academic year 2005-2006 was&nbsp;fastest and busiest year in my whole life, but after that year 2006 was comparatively relaxed and enthusiastic.<br />Now I am more happy welcoming 2007 as&nbsp;I&nbsp;am working&nbsp;on building the next big thing in MangoSpring with my favorite programming language and technology.<br /><font color="#00dd00"><strong>Happy New Year 2007!<br /><br /></strong></font><font color="#000000">I am waiting&nbsp;for <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0499375/">Guru</a> as music is given by&nbsp;Rahman and directed by Maniratnam.</font></p>
