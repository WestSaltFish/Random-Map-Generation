This is a test post! I am using Semagic1.5.6.3U client for posting this. Originally this is livejournal client. But I configured it to work with blogger. I am using it for a LiveJournal for last few months. It is free. You can get it at <a href="http://semagic.sourceforge.net/">http://semagic.sourceforge.net</a>
