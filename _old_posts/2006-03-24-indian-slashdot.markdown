I came to know about a great site to which I call Indian Slashdot! It is<br /><strong><span style="color:#a30712;"><span style="font-size:6;">Shunya.in</span><br /></span></strong>News for Indian techies; by Indian techies.<br />Its <a href="http://shunya.in/">link</a>. Its start is interesting! When slashdot rejected a story submitted by Kulpreet(its maker), as the story was not US centric. It is implemented on rubyonrails. The content is a lot better! Check it out!
