<p>I don’t like these submissions. Writing continuously without understanding. All bunches of pages within few days. What a hectic work it is? I think this is deadening. As my branch is computer, I have to do printing work (tedious work!), continuously from start to the end of the day. These 5 to 6 days kills me. Can I manage it before date of term end? Today is 11 of April. I have to do it before 15 of April. I am speeding myself for that. Go to college early in the morning, grab the printer, take print outs throughout the day, making lot of corrections. Obviously most of the programs are not written by me. So I don’t like this useless work.</p>
