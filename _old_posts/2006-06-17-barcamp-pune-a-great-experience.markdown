I attended <a href="http://barcamp.org/BarCampPune" target="_blank">BarCamp Pune</a>. It was a very very exciting event! This was the first BarCamp in Pune. All the talks were excellent.  With this event, I got chance to meet many bloggers and techie people. Many speakers and campers came from various cities. Planners planned BarCamp excellently! People shared their knowledge with each others! One of the camper, <a href="http://vidagdha.wordpress.com/about/" target="_blank">Shailesh Khandekar</a> took my interview while we were having lunch. He was blogging the interview live. you can check the interview <a href="http://vidagdha.wordpress.com/2006/06/17/barcamppani/">here</a>. Many campers also live blogged the event. You can search about BarCamp Pune on <a href="http://blogsearch.google.com/blogsearch?hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&q=BarCampPune&amp;scoring=d" target="_blank">Google Blogsearch</a>. I think BarCamp is really the great concept!
