I liked the features of mobile so much that I decided to buy it. This mobile is very good compared to Nokia's 6610i. It has Class 10 GPRS, WAP 2.0, FM Radio, Java (MIDP 2.0). These are the features which I liked the most. I have decided to use GPRS service from my AirTel card ( number 9860352988) for accessing the Internet. AirTel charges 5 Rs. per day for GPRS service. So I can use  internet 24 hours a day whole month for just 150 Rs. Woooo…………</p>
