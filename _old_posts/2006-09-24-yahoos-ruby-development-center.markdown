<a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/ruby"><img src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/4837/701/1600/yahooruby.gif" /></a><br /><br />While chatting with <a href="http://premshree.livejournal.com/">Premshree</a> few days ago, he told me that he has a good news. But he said that he will probably blog about it on his <a href="http://premshree.livejournal.com/">journal</a>. The good news is that Yahoo! launched its<a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/ruby/"> new section</a> under <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/">http://developer.yahoo.com</a> (probably by Premshree). Following is the post by Premshree on Yahoo Developer Network website<br /><h2 class="first"><span style="font-size:130%;"></span></h2><blockquote><h2 class="first"><span style="font-size:85%;">Ruby Developer Center Launches</span></h2> <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/">Ruby</a> is a beautiful language to write code in, and, thanks to <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.com/">Ruby on Rails</a>, it's being used quite a lot in web applications. If you're just getting started with Ruby, be sure to check out our <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/ruby/#resources">useful links</a>. If you're already familiar with the language and want to jump right in with Yahoo!'s web services, we've got a series of <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/ruby/#howto">HOWTOs</a> just for you.<p></p>  <p>We've also created a new Yahoo! Group: <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/ydn-ruby/">ydn-ruby</a>. Join up and get help, or discuss your favorite API tricks and techniques. </p>  <p>Finally, if you've built a Ruby-powered application, please consider uploading it to the <a href="http://gallery.yahoo.com/">Applications Gallery</a>.  We love to hear about your hacks!</p>  <p>Premshree Pillai </p>   <!-- http://developer.yahoo.net/blog/archives/2006/09/announcing_the_1.html -->   <p class="postdate">Posted: 21 September, 2006</p></blockquote><p class="postdate">As Yahoo have started it, I think I am going to see many biggies start using Ruby as Ruby is the very productive programming language.</p>
