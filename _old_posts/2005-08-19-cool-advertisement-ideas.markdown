These days, Idea Cellular have displayed cool hoardings of Marathi artists for their ad campaign in Pune. This is the first time, some mobile company have used Marathi actors on their Brand ads. I liked these Idea ads the most as it shows proud of my Maharashtra. I think this is the right way of advertising instead of showing boring vulgar ads.<br /><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/anildigital/35230988/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://photos32.flickr.com/35230988_ccd4547506_m.jpg" alt="getimage" height="132" width="240" /></a>
