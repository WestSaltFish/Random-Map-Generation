I will be leaving for Goa trip... in just few minutes... It is a <a href="http://mangospring.com">company</a> trip. It is also my first Goa trip, so I am pretty excited about it. We will spend four days there.. I hope it will be one of my memorable trips. All other guys/colleagues are much excited too.

Today, I got "Pat on the back" for my work at <a href="http://mangospring.com">MangoSpring</a>. I am happy and it is very inspiring to me.  I will write about the great product that we have built in coming days.

Happy Deepawali to all.
