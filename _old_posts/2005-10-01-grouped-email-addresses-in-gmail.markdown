Many of my friends tell me that they don’t use Gmail because it do not support grouped email addresses like rediff and yahoo. But actually we can create grouped email addresses in Gmail. This is a very simple hack.<br /><br />Click on Contacts (left-side menu) and choose Add Contact (top right corner). Enter a name for the group in the Name field. Then in the Primary Email field start inputting the addresses of group members. Here is the trick: leave out the first and last brackets. This is how you should do it (substituting the appropriate email addresses):<br /><img alt="" src="http://www.lifehacker.com/software/uploaded/2005-08-29/GMailGroupAddress.jpg" border="0" /><br />Then save the address. Once you save it, you can see that GMail puts a bracket around the list of addresses. You can try it out by clicking on Compose. Next time you want to send a note to this group, just start typing in the group name and the address list will come up as an option.<br /><br />From <a href="http://g04.com/html/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=78">Creating a Pseudo Address Group</a> [Jim’s Tips]
