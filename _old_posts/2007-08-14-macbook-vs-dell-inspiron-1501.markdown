I got stumbled upon this nice discussion about Macbook vs Dell Inspiron on <a href="http://pownce.com">Pownce</a>.

I liked this reply which has
<blockquote>"The Mac is always the best computer! White = minimalist and is fantastic! Dell tried to beef up it's design and in turn made their notebook line crappier. As far as the OS goes... when Dell's CEO says that, "If Apple were to license the Mac OS for beige boxes, we would drop Windows" you know something is up. :-) Get the Mac!!!! It will leave you happier and is screaming fast."</blockquote>
Macbooks are already winners! Macbook Pro is a dream. I would really like to say "Mac is the future.  Grab it up!"
