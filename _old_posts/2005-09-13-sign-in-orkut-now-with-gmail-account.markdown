That means from now you can sign into Orkut with your Gmail/Google account username and password. Great!!!! Few days ago Yahoo have started integrating Flickr into Yahoo, you can log in to Flickr using your Yahoo username and password. This integration is very important for Google and Yahoo to keep their identity. I am a great fan of Orkut also Flickr. Now I am more happy as I am getting more ease for accessing my information. I am a person who likes integrity. As you can see my blog have various services that I use listed.<br /><img alt="" src="http://img234.imageshack.us/img234/4760/orkut1cf.jpg" border="0" />
