<div style="text-align: justify;">Oreilly has a great <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/h/4807">article</a> about using Google as a free proxy. You can access restricted web sites using Google language tools service as a proxy.You can translate a webpage, using Google translator, to access it even if restricted.<br /><br />Proxy is a device that stands between a PC and the internet, providing all the conncetions to the word wide web. What a proxy does is to receive all data from a requested site, so when you access web pages all data come from proxy.<br /><br />When we use net in office/colleges/universities, services are set to provide more safety blocking the access to unrestricted web sites. What you can do now is use Google translator service (language tools) as a proxy to bypass the restrictions.<br /><span class="secondary3"><br />You just need to type the following URL:<br /><br /></span><span class="secondary3"><b> <code>http://www.google.com/translate?langpair=en|en&amp;u=www.xyz.com</code></b></span><br /><span class="secondary3"><b><code></code></b></span><span class="secondary3"> (www.xyz.com stands for the URL you need to go to...)</span></div>
