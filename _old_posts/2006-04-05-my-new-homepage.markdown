Few days ago, I created my homepage on <a href="http://pages.google.com/">Google Pages</a>. But due to spamming reasons, I stopped that! But today I have created my new homepage <a href="http://anil.webhop.info/">http://anil.webhop.info</a>. Actually it is hosted on <a href="http://geocities.com/">Geocities</a>. But with the help of <a href="https://www.dyndns.com/">DynDNS</a>â€™s WebHop service I chose <a href="http://anil.webhop.info/">this</a> new URL. Do check it out!
