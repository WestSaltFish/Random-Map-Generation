Thanks Gmail/Google for new <a href="http://gmailblog.blogspot.com/2007/10/sync-your-inbox-across-devices-with.html">IMAP support</a> for Gmail. It is the most imp. feature.. that I wanted Gmail must have. I have set up my <a href="http://mail.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?answer=77663">Apple Mail for IMAP</a> on Macbook.  Now because of IMAP, I can use Gmail and Apple Mail in sync. If I flag a mail in Apple Mail, it will be automatically starred in Gmail.  My Gmail labels are now carried in Apple Mail as folders. If I move an email from a folder to another. It will be automatically relabeled in web Gmail. Also the status of read / unread email is in sync. IMAP is really something.. that will change how I use Email. Kudos to Google!
