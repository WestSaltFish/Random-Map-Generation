USB thumb drives have shown themselves to be a superior alternative to other portable media such as diskettes and writable optical discs. They're smaller and can hold tons of data, and most current operating systems recognize them without needing any special drivers. </p><p>Most people don't realize that these drives can also carry enough applications to serve as a personal office on the road, and can even contain a complete bootable operating system to provide total security when you are computing away from home. There are plenty of reasons to carry applications or an operating system on your USB drive: You'll have your e-mail and instant messaging accounts, Internet bookmarks, log-on passwords, and even document templates instantly available on any computer you find in a hotel's computer center, a home, or an office that you might visit. You can also be certain that your settings will stay on your USB drive and won't be stored in the browser cache or anywhere else on a remote machine. I will choose a 256MB USB thumb drive, as it will satisfy all my needs. Most of the apps can run entirely from the USB drive without installation. I am going for Transcend which is very cheap and have good quality. Most of my friends recommened it to me.<br />For a List of Portable USB Programs click <a href="http://combobulate.com/usbutils.htm">here.</a><br /></p>
