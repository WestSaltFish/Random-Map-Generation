These heavy rains made a fault in the Airtel tower so I was unable to access GPRS service in my area. So I was out of the internet world for last 3 days. From then, I made 9 complaints to Airtel call centre and they took action today and activated GPRS service in the tower. The Airtel guy called me today and checked that if GPRS is working. I haven't expected such a fault will ever occur. I like the GPRS! I never want such things happen in future.
