<div style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">I have just setup mephisto on my server <a title="http://anil.rails.in" href="http://anil.rails.in">http://anil.rails.in</a>   which was gifted to me by <a title="Pratik" href="http://null.in">Pratik</a>. <a title="http://anil.rails.in" href="http://anil.rails.in/">http://anil.rails.in</a> will be my new weblog which will highlight my experimets in ruby and rails. As I have already mentioned that mephisto is the creation of Rick Olson(<strong><u>technoweenie</u></strong>). His apps are really awesome. I also like this decent URL http://anil.rails.in. I think this new rails blog will give me enough exposure in the r*** world.<br />These days, I am totally involved in project which is on Ruby on Rails. So I have no time for anything other than studying and working for the project. I hope, I will explore more ruby and rails in coming future.<br /></div>
