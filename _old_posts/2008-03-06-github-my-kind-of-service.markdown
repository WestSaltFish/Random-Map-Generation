Recently I got interested in using <a href="http://git.or.cz">Git</a>. I like it too much. I already have some Git repositories on my <a href="http://slicehost.com">Slicehost</a> server. From last month, I am using a Git repository hosting service <a href="http://github.com">GitHub.com</a>. I have become a fan of this service. Now I have two homes for my projects' repositories, one is <a href="http://github.com/anildigital">GitHub</a> and other on my Slicehost server.

It always felt good to commit changes locally, push them to server with one command. Git added that geeky-ness to my coding. I came to know about GitHub when I read this <a href="http://ozmm.org/posts/what_are_you_working_on.html">post</a>. Since then, I was waiting for its launch and one good day, I got beta invite for GitHub from <a href="http://errtheblog.com">Chris</a>.

GitHub brings a social aspect into play. GitHub is kind of social network for developers with codes. I almost felt it when I forked a repository first time.

Git has very nice features. Some of which I like the most are forking, sending pull requests, nice UI of repository browser, news feeds, follow, hCard-ed profiles and simple project wikis etc.
I think Git adoption by developers is very near. Fantastic tool like GitHub is making it happen. I am very happy to be early adopter of this service.

I know, this is the kind of app/service which is really benefiting me than any-other as it is helping for coding and improving it. I think it is one of the best things on internets

<strong>Update</strong>: Oh yeah, I have a couple github invites if anyone wants them.
