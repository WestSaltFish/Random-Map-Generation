<p>I just found a <a href="http://www.hacknot.info/hacknot/action/showEntry?eid=90" target="_blank">very nice article</a> explaining the difference between a <strong>developer</strong> and a <strong>programmer</strong>. Some of the key points are</p> <ul> <li>Developers have some knowledge of the domain and the business  </li><li>Developers care about maintenance burden  </li><li>Developers know that work methods are more important than technical chops  </li><li>Programmers try to solve every problem by coding  </li><li>Developers seek repeatability, programmers like one-off heroics  </li><li>Programmers like complexity, developers favor simplicity  </li><li>Developers care about users  </li><li>Developers like to satisfy a need, programmers like to finish  </li><li>Developers work, programmers play</li></ul> <p>Who am I then? I think I have qualities according to which I am a software developer. But I am strongly eagerous to become a programmer. I am in the process of becoming a good programmer. I am a <u>wannabe programmer</u>.</p>
