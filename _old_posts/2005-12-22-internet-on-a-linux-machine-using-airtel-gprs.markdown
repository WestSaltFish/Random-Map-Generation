<div style="text-align: justify;">I am writing this post on Linux(Fedora Core 4). Few days ago, I successfully connected net on Linux machine using my mobile with Airtel GPRS. Using internet on Linux is a great experience!<br />From long time I wanted it but I was unsuccessful. But one day, one of the members in <a href="http://www.plug.org.in/">PLUG</a> posted article on its mailing list about connecting internet from Airtel GPRS using Linux machine. The article was very helpful. I got connected.<br />Now it will help me to learn Linux more easily because I can directly search my queries related to Linux on Google. A lot of material on Linux is available on the net. Previously I was hating linux because lack of availability of internet. But from now I will try to use Linux as more as I can. I am thinking of learning more technologies related to Linux.<br />Here is the <a href="http://www.mobguru.com/Linux+GPRS+Bluetooth.htm">link</a> of a post written by Anurag Joshi. It will be helpful to you connect net on Linux with Airtel GPRS. Airtel GPRS is a fad among my friends, beacuse it gives fulltime internet just for Rs. 150 per month.</div>
