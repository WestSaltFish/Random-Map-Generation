<p align="justify"><img alt="Yahoo!" src="http://img219.imageshack.us/img219/8370/y34dm.gif" align="left" border="0" />Yahoo have started giving “dot” email addresses. Now you can have two Yahoo mail ids for one account. I had anildigital [at] yahoo.co.in as my email ID. But now I created anil.wadghule [at] yahoo.co.in a secondary email ID for the same account. This means if you mail me on any of both addresses, I get the mails on the same account. I can sign into my account with any of both email IDs. Here is the <a href="http://updates.mail.yahoo.com/blog/?p=8">link</a> for Yahoo mail beta announcement. So <a href="http://edit.yahoo.com/config/list_alias?.src=ym">go here</a> to get one !</p>
