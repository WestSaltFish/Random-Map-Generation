<p>The new <a href="http://beta.messenger.yahoo.com/" target="_blank">Yahoo! Messenger 7 beta</a> allows you to make PC-to-PC calls, just click on ‘Call’ and talk (to your online buddy who can be anywhere in the world) as if you are talking on a real phone, without the expense. </p><p>But VoIP is illegal in India, so we have an <a href="http://in.beta.messenger.yahoo.com/">Indian version</a> without that feature. </p><p>Damn.</p><p><em>Technorati Tag</em>: <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tags/yahoo" rel="tag">Yahoo!</a></p>
