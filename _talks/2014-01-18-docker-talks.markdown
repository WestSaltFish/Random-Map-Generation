I have been intrigued with [Docker](http://docker.io) since the day I came to know about it.

I explored it more and used for my personal side projects.

I gave talk on Docker at [Pune Ruby Users Group meetup](http://www.meetup.com/PuneRailsMeetup/events/159959042/) in January and
organized first [Docker Pune meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Docker-Pune/events/165011992/) at Equal Experts India office. I spoke
about Docker there too. Below are slides.
